//! Category deletion operations for the Personal Ledger database.
//!
//! This module provides functions for deleting category records from the SQLite database.
//! It supports single deletions, bulk deletions with transactional guarantees, and
//! targeted deletions by various criteria.
//!
//! All deletion operations are permanent and cannot be undone. They ensure data integrity
//! by checking for existence before deletion and using transactions for atomic bulk operations.
//!
//! The module follows these key principles:
//! - **Safety**: Existence checks prevent silent failures
//! - **Atomicity**: Bulk operations use transactions to ensure consistency
//! - **Observability**: Detailed tracing from TRACE to ERROR levels
//! - **Security**: No sensitive data logged; operations are idempotent where possible
