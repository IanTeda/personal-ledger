<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Personal Ledger Screenshot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/IanTeda/personal-ledger)

**Personal Ledger** aims to provide its users with an intuitive and user-friendly interface that offers insights into their spending habits and investment position. By presenting information clearly and concisely, users can effectively monitor their overall financial health, make informed decisions, and ultimately achieve their personal financial goals.

Motivation for Personal Ledger:

* Applications in general are opinionated, and finance applications are no different. Looking at the finance applications available, none ticked my boxes or were monthly subscription models with high fees.
* I niavely thought I could do it better.
* Funsy project to hone my programming skills.
